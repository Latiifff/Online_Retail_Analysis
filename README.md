# Online Retail Data Mastery: In-Depth Analysis with Dashboard for RFM Segmentation, Clustering, Cohorts, and Predictive Forecasting
This project utilizes advanced data analytics to enhance retail business performance through a comprehensive dashboard featuring RFM Segmentation, Clustering, Cohort Analysis, and Predictive Forecasting. The dashboard aims to address key business problems such as improving customer retention by categorizing customers with RFM analysis, enhancing customer segmentation using clustering techniques, gaining insights into customer behavior over time with cohort analysis, and optimizing sales by predicting future product demand through forecasting. Additional KPIs, including Total Customers, Total Product Sold, Total Revenue, and Average Order Value (AOV), are monitored to assess performance and guide strategic decision-making.
